# Teaching  

Bertrand Russells onces wrote, "What have I lived for? Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: **the longing for love**, **the search for knowledge**, and **the unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind**. " I feel you, Sir. I love the teaching & learning process. The positive reinforcement between them is a intriguing experience that satisfies my deep curiosity about the world. 


Over the years, I tend to learn things bottom-up so that I can have a in-depth understanding of things that I wanna learn.  It fits with the teaching activity, since I am able to provide students and myself with detailed logical explanations for 'Why' questions. However, sometimes such a thirst for details is like a obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) for logically rigorousness which can slow down the learning process. Just like a balance between exploration and exploitation is needed in reinforcement learning,  a balance between the top-down approach and the bottom-up approach is also required, so that a equilibrium between the breadth and the depth of understanding can be reached.
